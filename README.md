# Invoices App API

Invoices App API is a dockerized API platform built with Laravel 11. This project provides an environment for managing invoices with JWT authentication and Swagger-powered API documentation. The application is containerized using Docker, making it simple to set up a development or production environment.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Git

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the Laravel application.
- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build file defining both development and production images.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Orchestrates the services including PHP (Laravel), Nginx, PostgreSQL for production (`db`), and a separate PostgreSQL instance for tests (`test_db`).
- **nginx/conf.d/default.conf**: Nginx configuration file.
- **.env**: Environment variables for the application. There is one for the main app and one for tests.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Inside the `src/` directory, create a copy of the provided `.env` file if it isnâ€™t already present. Adjust the environment variables if needed.

For the main application, use the provided `.env`.

For testing purposes, use the separate environment configuration.

### 3. Build and Start Containers

Build and start the Docker containers using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This command will build the PHP image (using the development target), start the Nginx server, and launch the PostgreSQL databases.

### 4. Install Dependencies and Setup Laravel

The Dockerfile automatically installs Composer dependencies. If you need to run additional Composer commands, execute them within the PHP container:

```bash
docker-compose exec php composer install
```

Generate the application key (if not already set):

```bash
docker-compose exec php php artisan key:generate
```

### 5. Database Setup

Run Laravel migrations and seeders to set up your database schema:

```bash
docker-compose exec php php artisan migrate
```

```bash
docker-compose exec php php artisan db:seed
```

## Running the Application

Once the containers are running, access the application at [http://localhost](http://localhost). Nginx serves the application from the `public` directory inside the Laravel app.

## Testing Environment

The Docker Compose file includes a separate PostgreSQL service for tests (`test_db`). Configure your testing environment to use these credentials, and run tests inside the PHP container:

```bash
docker-compose exec php php artisan test
```

Ensure your testing `.env` file is properly configured to point to the `test_db` service.

## API Documentation

This project integrates Swagger for API documentation using the L5 Swagger package. To generate or update the API docs, run:

```bash
docker-compose exec php php artisan l5-swagger:generate
```

You can then view the documentation at the configured base path (e.g., `http://localhost/api/documentation`).

## Additional Commands

- **Run Artisan Commands:**  
  ```bash
  docker-compose exec php php artisan <command>
  ```

- **View Container Logs:**  
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs -f
  ```

- **Stop Containers:**  
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

## Production vs Development

The project uses a multi-stage Dockerfile:
- **Development Stage:** Uses `php:8.3-fpm`, includes debugging enabled, and mounts the local `src/` directory.
- **Production Stage:** Uses `php:8.3-fpm-alpine`, optimizes the autoloader, and removes development dependencies.

Adjust your build target accordingly when deploying to production.
